- heuristics
- experiments -> finding smoothing parameter (alpha), finding stop words
- implementing bigram/trigram, memory constraints
- divide and conquer
- tried but failed:

  - using k fold cross validation for smoothing
  - stemming
  - tf -idf

- further improvements
  - identifying keywords (words not in dict, apperaing over n times in document)
  - finding hyperparameter for divide and conquer
